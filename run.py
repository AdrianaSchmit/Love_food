import gspread
#gspread, which is a library of code  that we will use to access and update data in our spreadsheet. Essentially this import, imports the entire gspread library,  
from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials

to set up the authentication needed  to access our Google Cloud project. 
 imports the Credentials class,

""" Now our scope and creds variables  are ready, weâ€™ll create a new variable, 
called SCOPED_CREDS. Using the  with_scopes method of the creds object,  
and pass it our scope variable. """

""" Next, we create our GSPREAD_CLIENT.  
Using the gspread authorize method,  and pass it our SCOPED_CREDS. """

using the open() method on our client object  and passing it the name we gave our spreadsheet. """
